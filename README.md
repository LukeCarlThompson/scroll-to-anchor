# js-library-template
### A template built for creating javascript libraries and general tinkering.

It uses gulp, scss, browserSync, Rollup and buble.

### Folder structure
**_src/** - is where you work  
**dev/** - is where the browserSync server runs from  
**dist/** - contains the processed js files  


### Get started
1. `npm install` - install dependencies
2. `npm run dev` - spins up the dev server
3. `npm run build` - transpiles and builds final js files in dist/ folder
